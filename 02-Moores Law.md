Gordon Moore was a co-founder of intel and purposed a law for computers which states that the number of transistors in a processor doubles each year.

Since the transistors double in capacity the cost would also increase but that isn't the case. The cost of modern computing equipment has fallen so low that you can get a computer for as low as 70$ or even lower.

This rapid pace of innovation and improvements have also been shown in the field of communications as well. The amount of bandwidth that can be sent throughout the world using the internet has greatly improved. Normal consumers have around 1 to 10Gb internet connections.
