A computer can perform calculations faster than a group of humans, most computers perform billions of calculations in seconds which is more than a human can ever do in his lifetime.

Supercomputers can perform quadrillions of computations in just a second. The IBM Summit supercomputer can perform over 122 quadrillion calculations in a second.

Computers do all of these calculations based on the programs that programmers write for them. Programs are like guides that tell the computer what calculations need to be performed.
