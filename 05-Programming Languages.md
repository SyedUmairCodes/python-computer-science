Programmers write instructions for computers in programming languages, some programming languages are easy to learn and humans can read the code written easily and these languages are called high-level languages.

Instructions are easy to write but require a compiler or an interpreter to convert the high-level code into machine code

Each computer has its own machine language and it can understand that language clearly since it is defined by the hardware design. Machine languages are machine dependent. Code written for an x86 computer cannot run on an ARM based computer.

Writing code in machine language is too complicated for humans so assembly languages and assemblers were created that can use english-like abbrevations to define and represent the operations in the code.

Assemblers were written for each assembly language that can convert the assembly code into machine language code.
