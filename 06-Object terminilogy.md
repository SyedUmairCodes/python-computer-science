The modern developers needs to build software quickly and needs to create more software depending on the needs of the users and the business models that their company follows.

The Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses reusable objects that once created can be used in all kinds of software.

Every software is built using different components and these components can be used in any other software as well.

There are date objects, time objects, audio objects, video objects, automobile objects, people objects, etc. Almost any noun can be reasonably represented as a software object in terms of attributes (e.g., name, color and size) and behaviors.
