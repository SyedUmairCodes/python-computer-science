Data that's processed by a computer follows hierarchical rule. All the data is stored in a file that file has multiple records and each records has multiple fields depending on the data the records have different characters and each character and record is stored as a bit in the memory.

A bit is the smallest amount of data that can be stored in a computer. It's a binary value so it can only exist in two states, 0 or 1. 

Working with low-level forms of bits known as binary values are very difficult to work with. We can use characters which are made up of different binary values added together. Characters can be whole numbers, letters, and even special symbols.

Each computer has its own character set. Computers process only 1s and 0s, so a computer’s character set represents every character as a pattern of 1s and 0s.

Unicode contains characters for many of the world’s languages. The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set is a subset of Unicode that represents letters (a–z and A–Z), digits and some common special characters.

Just as characters are composed of bits, fields are composed of characters or bytes. A field is a group of characters or bytes that conveys meaning. For example, a field consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters can be used to represent a person’s name, and a field consisting of decimal digits could represent a person’s age.

A record is a collection of multiple records that are stored inside a file. All the records belong to a field.

A file is a group of related records. More generally, a file contains arbitrary data in arbitrary formats. In some operating systems, a file is viewed simply as a sequence of bytes any organization of the bytes in a file, such as organizing the data into records, is a view created by
the application programmer.

A database is a collection of data organized for easy access and manipulation. The most popular model is the relational database, in which data is stored in simple tables. A table includes records and fields.

The amount of data being produced worldwide is enormous and its growth is accelerating. Big data applications deal with massive amounts of data. This field is growing quickly, creating lots of opportunity for software developers. Millions of IT jobs globally already are
supporting big data applications.
