Performing a task in a program requires a method. The method houses the program statements that perform its tasks.

he method hides these statements from its user, just as the accelerator pedal of a car hides from the driver the mechanisms of making the car go faster.

> In Python, a program unit called a class houses the set of methods that perform the class’s tasks.

A class that represents a bank account might contain one method to deposit money to an account, another to withdraw money from an account and a third to inquire what the account’s balance is.
